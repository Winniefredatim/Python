                <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>
                <p>
                    Python is a web server programming language. Every programmer hs a story about how they learned to write their first program, I wrote my first code in <cite>October 2018</cite>. <strong>Why Python?</strong>, Python is an incredibly efficient language, your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. Python syntax will also help you write "<cite>clean</cite>" code, your code will be easy to read, easy to debug and easy to build upoun compared to other languages.

                <h2>Getting started</h2>
                <p>
                    First you will need to check whether python is installed on your computer, if it isn't, you'll have to install it. You'll also install a text editor to work with your python programs. Text editors recognize python code and highlight sections as you write, making it easy to understand the structure of your code.

                <h2>Variables and simple data types</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    A variable holds a value which is the information associated with that variable. Adding a variable makes a little more work for the python interpreter, when it processes the first line, it associates the text <cite>"Hello World</cite> with the varaible message. When it reaches the second line, it prints the value associated with the messageto the screen.

                    <h3>Data types</h3>
                    Data types include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strings:</strong> A string is simply a series of characters inside quotes (the quotes can be single or double).</li>
                        <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> This is also another data type which is divided into <cite>Integers</cite> and <cite> Floats.</cite></li>
                        <li><strong>Comments:</strong> These are data types in python which allows a programmer to write notes in English within a program and it is indicated using the hash mark (#)</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Lists</h2>
                <p>
                    Lists allows a programmer to store sets of information in one place whether you just have few items or millions of items. Lists are one of <i>Python's most powerful features</i> readily available to new programmers and they tie together many important concepts in programming. A list is a collection of items in a particular order and it is indicated by <strong>Square brackets ([])</strong> for example <cite> bicycles = [trek, specialized, redline]</cite> print(bicycles), if python is to print, it returns [trek, specialized, redline].

                <h2>If statements</h2>
                <p>
                    Python's <i>If statement</i> allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to the state. At the heart of every <i> if statement</i> is an expression that can be evaluated as <i>True</i> or <i>False</i> and this is called a <cite>Conditional test.</cite>

                <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
                <p>
                    A dictionary is a collection of <strong>Key-value pairs.</strong> It allows a programmer to connect pieces of related information. It stores limitless amount of information. Each key is connected to a value and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key.

                <h2>Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    Functions are named blocks of code desighned to do one specific job. When you want to perform a particular task that you've defined in a function, you call the name of the function responsible for it and if you need to perform that task multiple times throughout the program, you just call the function dedicated to handling that task.
